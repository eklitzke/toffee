<h2>Technical Details</h2>
<p>
  Toffee runs off of a custom DNS server built using the
  excellent <a href="http://www.monkey.org/~provos/libevent/">libevent</a>
  non-blocking I/O library. libevent version 2 contains an API for building DNS
  servers, and that's what toffee uses.
</p>

<h2>Why a Custom DNS Server?</h2>
<p>
  The simple answer why we use a custom DNS server is that it's the simplest and
  most efficient way to provide an extremely dynamic custom DNS service like
  this. Most DNS servers are designed for organizations with a relatively static
  infrastructure. Programatically updating DNS configuration for DNS servers
  like BIND and djbdns is difficult and awkward. It frequently involves writing
  complex scripts that generate dns databases and rsync these databases
  around. We can do better than that.
</p>
<h2>Bugs</h2>
<p>
  We take the speed, reliability, and correctness of toffee very seriously. We
  commit to resolving any bugs you find in toffee immediately; at the time of
  this writing, there are <em>no known bugs</em> in toffee. If you notice DNS
  features which are not fully supported by toffee, or experience any other
